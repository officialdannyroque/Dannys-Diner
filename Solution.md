## ‚úÖ Solutions

### 1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?

```sql
WITH product_spend AS (SELECT customer_id, s.product_id, price * COUNT(s.product_id) AS spend
		       FROM sales s
		       INNER JOIN menu m
		       ON s.product_id = m.product_id
		       GROUP BY customer_id, s.product_id, price)

SELECT customer_id, SUM(spend) AS total_spend
FROM product_spend
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id;
```

**Result set:**

| customer_id | total_sales |
|-------------|-------------|
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |
| C           | 36          |

### 2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?

```sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) AS num_visits
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

**Result set:**

| customer_id | num_visits  |
|-------------|-------------|
| A           | 4           |
| B           | 6           |
| C           | 2           |

### 3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?

```sql
WITH ranked_orders AS (SELECT customer_id, product_id, order_date,
			      RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) AS earliest_order_rank
			      FROM sales)

SELECT 		r.customer_id, m.product_name
FROM   		ranked_orders r
INNER JOIN  	menu m
ON 		r.product_id = m.product_id
WHERE		r.earliest_order_rank = 1
ORDER BY 	customer_id;
```

**Result set:**

| customer_id | product_name |
|-------------|--------------|
| A           | curry        |
| A           | sushi        |
