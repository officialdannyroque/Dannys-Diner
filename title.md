### 1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?

```sql
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    SUM(price) AS total_sales
FROM dannys_diner.menu
INNER JOIN dannys_diner.sales
USING (product_id)
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id;

**Result:**

| customer_id | total_sales |
|-------------|-------------|
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |
