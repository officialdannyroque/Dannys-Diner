# Dannys-Diner
🧁 Introduction
At the start of 2021, Danny — a passionate fan of Japanese cuisine — decided to take a leap of faith and open his own restaurant: Danny’s Diner. Specializing in his three favorite dishes — sushi, curry, and ramen — the cozy spot quickly attracted a small but loyal customer base.

Now a few months in, Danny is looking to make data-driven decisions to help his business grow. Although he’s been collecting basic data on customer visits and orders, he needs help turning that data into actionable insights.

🧩 Problem Statement
Danny wants to better understand his customers — their visit habits, spending behavior, and favorite menu items. With this knowledge, he hopes to enhance the customer experience and decide whether expanding his loyalty program makes strategic sense.

Your task is to analyze the available data and help Danny answer key business questions that will guide his next steps.

📊 Datasets Overview
The case study includes three key datasets:

sales: Contains each customer’s purchases, including customer_id, order_date, and product_id.

menu: Links product_id to the corresponding product_name and price.

members: Records the join_date for each customer_id that enrolled in Danny’s beta loyalty program.

❓ Case Study Questions
What is the total amount each customer has spent at the restaurant?

How many days has each customer visited?

What was the first item each customer purchased?

What is the most popular menu item, and how many times was it ordered?

Which item is the top choice for each customer?

What was the first item a customer purchased after joining the loyalty program?

What item did a customer purchase just before becoming a member?

How many items and how much did each member spend before joining?

If every $1 spent equals 10 points (with sushi earning double points), how many points does each customer have?

In the first week after joining (including join date), customers earn 2x points on all items. How many points do customers A and B have by the end of January?
